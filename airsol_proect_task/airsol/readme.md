Title: Airsol real estate project 
Description:  We think the Airsol project is guaranteed to be number one in the real estate industry. 
Airsol takes a 3% commission in the case of renting or buying a house, a person in any part of the world
can rent out their home or rent a house without using any bank, why should you choose us? While a commission
of 5-10% is taken on an airbnb or zillow style site, a 3% commission is taken in the Airsol project. 

 

 1.Go inside the Frontend folder
 2. Run `npm install` or `yarn install` at the root of your directory
3. Run `yarn dev` to start the project
4. Start renting your homes rather than selling them!
